> From Hustle to BOSS.

BOSS is an **Economic Legitimacy Infrastructure** for informal businesses in Africa.
It helps tailors (and other artisans) become trusted, organised, visible, and bankable.

**Live demo:** [boss-africa.vercel.app](https://boss-africa.vercel.app)

## Why BOSS Exists

Most tailors and artisans in Nigeria's informal economy run their business from memory and WhatsApp — no records, no way to prove income, no path to credit. BOSS turns everyday business activity (orders, payments, repeat customers) into a **trust score** that makes an informal business legible to banks, lenders, and customers, without requiring the tailor to change how they already work day-to-day.

## What Makes This Interesting Technically

- **Real-time trust scoring**: the BOS Score is recomputed from live order/payment state — a weighted model across completion rate, repeat customers, payment consistency, and revenue signal — not a static field.
- **State-heavy, flow-based UI**: navigation is built around modal "Flows" (AddOrder, OrderDetail, CustomerDetail, Reminders) layered over a persistent tab shell, with a floating action sheet for entry points — closer to a native app interaction model than typical CRUD screens.
- **Offline-resilient data layer**: `lib/db.js` pairs Supabase with a localStorage cache so the app stays usable on unreliable connections, a real constraint for the target users.
- **Public-facing invoice pages** generated per order, with payment details (bank/crypto) auto-embedded — solving distribution without requiring the customer to have an account.

## How Payments Work

BOSS does **not** collect payments. The tailor receives money directly.

```
Tailor records a new order:
  → sets price, deposit, delivery date
  → shares WhatsApp receipt with payment details (bank account, crypto address)
  → customer pays via bank transfer, cash, or crypto
  → tailor records payment in the app manually
```

**Payment details on receipts:** The tailor's bank name, account number, and crypto address (if set) are automatically included on WhatsApp receipts and the public invoice page.
